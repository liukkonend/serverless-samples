# python-rest-sam
This is implementation of the backend REST API using Python and AWS SAM. 

## Project structure
This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI). It includes the following files and folders:

- `src\api` - Code for the application's Lambda functions and Lambda Authorizer.
- `src\api\swagger.yaml` - API definition in OpenAPI 2.0.
- `events` - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `tests/unit` - Unit tests for the application code. 
- `tests/integration` - Integration tests for the API. 
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- `env.json` - A file with environment variables' values for local invocation.
- `pipeline.yaml` - A template that defines the application's CI/CD pipeline.
- `buildspec.yml` - A template that defines the application's build process.
- `tests/testspec.yml` - A template that defines the API's test process (both unit and integration testing).

This example uses partial API Gateway [definition](./src/api/swagger.yaml) in [OpenAPI v2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) in combination with [AWS::Include transform macro](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html). Note that CORS definition is in stack template along with logging and tracing settings, etc.
See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-resource-api.html#sam-api-definitionbody) for more details on how to use OpenAPI to define your APIs.


The application uses shared Amazon Cognito stack for authentication/authorization. You will need to create this stack and update `template.yaml` parameters section with the stack name. See next section for details

The application utilizes API Gateway [Usage Plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html). You may need to generate API keys using CLI or AWS Console. See manual deployment instructions section of this document for more details.
## Amazon Cognito setup
This example uses shared stack that deploys Amazon Cognito resources. The shared stack will be deployed automatically if you use CI/CD pipeline. See [README.md](../shared/README.md) in shared resources directory for the stack manual deployment instructions. After manual deployment is finished make sure to update your SAM template file `template.yaml` parameter CognitoStackName with the shared Cognito stack name. 

After stack is created manually you will need to create user account for authentication/authorization. Deployment by CI/CD pipeline will perform following steps for you automatically. 

- Navigate to URL specified in the shared stack template outputs as CognitoLoginURL and click link "Sign Up". After filling in new user registration form you should receive email with verification code, use it to confirm your account. 

- After this first step step your new user account will be able to access public data and create new bookings. To add locations and resources you will need to navigate to AWS Console, pick Amazon Cognito service, select User Pool instance that was created during this deployment, navigate to "Users and Groups", and add your user to administrative users group. 

- As an alternative to the AWS Console you can use AWS CLI to create and confirm user signup:
```bash
    aws cognito-idp sign-up --client-id <cognito user pool application client id> --username <username> --password <password> --user-attributes Name="name",Value="<username>"
    aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up --user-pool-id <cognito user pool id> --username <username> 
```

While using command line or third party tools such as Postman to test APIs, you will need to provide Identity Token in the request "Authorization" header. You can authenticate with Amazon Cognito User Pool using AWS CLI (this command is also available in SAM template outputs) and use IdToken value present in the output of the command:

```bash
aws cognito-idp initiate-auth --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH --client-id <cognito user pool application client id> --auth-parameters USERNAME=<username>,PASSWORD=<password>
```

## Manually deploy the sample application
***Note:** Before deploying application manually first time you will need to deploy shared Cognito stack, see previous section for details.*

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  
You may need manually create a virtualenv:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies for CDK and API implementation.

```
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -U wheel setuptools
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
```

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
* **Parameter CognitoStackName**: The shared Cognito stack name 
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

The API Gateway endpoint API and ID will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete.

### Usage plans

This application utilizes API Gateway [Usage Plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html). Usage plan references (Basic and Enterprise) will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete. 

You will need to generate API keys and associate them with usage plan using AWS CLI or [AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-setup-api-key-with-console.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create-apikey). API key value generated will need to be included as X-API-Key header in your requests.


To generate new API key using AWS CLI you can use following command (note the key ID and value in the output):

```bash
aws apigateway create-api-key --name 'Development API Key' --enabled 
```

After API key is created you will need to add it to the appropriate usage plan:

```bash
aws apigateway create-usage-plan-key --usage-plan-id '<Usage plan ID from the stack outputs>' --key-type "API_KEY" --key-id '<API key ID from the previous command>'
```

## Use the AWS SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application by using the `sam build` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam build --use-container
```

The AWS SAM CLI installs dependencies that are defined in `requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

***Note:** Before invoking function locally update environment variable file  env.json to pass correct DynamoDB table names. For more details see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-invoke.html#serverless-sam-cli-using-invoke-environment-file*

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command. 

```bash
my-application$ sam local invoke LocationsFunction --event events/event-put-location.json --env-vars env.json
my-application$ sam local invoke LocationsFunction --event events/event-get-all-locations.json --env-vars env.json
```

The AWS SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` command to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
my-application$ sam local start-api --env-vars env.json
my-application$ curl http://localhost:3000/locations
```
## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs
To simplify troubleshooting, the AWS SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs that are generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

***NOTE:** This command works for all Lambda functions, not just the ones you deploy using AWS SAM.*

```bash
my-application$ sam logs -n LocationsFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

***NOTE:** This uses the logical name of the function within the stack. This is the correct name to use when searching logs inside an AWS Lambda function within a CloudFormation stack, even if the deployed function name varies due to CloudFormation's unique resource name generation.*

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [AWS SAM CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests
Unit tests are defined in the `tests\unit` folder in this project. Use `pip` to install the ./tests/requirements.txt and run unit tests.

```bash
my-application$ pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
my-application$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
```
## Deploy CI/CD pipeline for the application
To create the CI/CD pipeline we will split out code for this set of examples from the serverless-samples repository into a separate directory and use it as a codebase for our pipeline. 

First, navigate to the root directory of the repository. To verify it run command *basename "$PWD"* - it should return serverless-samples as an output. Then run the following commands:

```bash
git subtree split -P serverless-rest-api -b serverless-rest-api
mkdir ../serverless-rest-api-cicd && cd ../serverless-rest-api-cicd
git init -b main
git pull ../serverless-samples serverless-rest-api
cd python-rest-sam
```

To create the pipeline you will need to run the following command:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline --template-body file://pipeline.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
The pipeline will attempt to run and will fail at the SourceCodeRepo stage as there is no code in the AWS CodeCommit yet.

***NOTE:** If you change stack name, avoid stack names longer than 25 characters. IUn case you need longer stack names check comments in the pipeline.yaml and update accordingly.*

***Note:** You may need to set up AWS CodeCommit repository access for HTTPS users [using Git credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html?icmpid=docs_acc_console_connect_np) and [set up the AWS CLI Credential Helper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/codecommit/connect-tc-alert-np).*

Once you have access to the code repository, navigate to python-rest-sam folder, and, if you changed stack name, make sure that Parameters section of template.yaml is updated with the output values from the shared Cognito stack, and push code base to CodeCommit to start automated deployments:

```bash
git remote add origin <URL to AWS CodeCommit repository>
git push origin main
```

Navigate to the CodePipeline in AWS Management Console and release this change if needed by clicking "Release change" button.

Note that same Amazon Cognito stack is used in both testing and production deployment stages, same user credentials can be used for testing and API access.

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api
```

If you created CI/CD pipeline you will need to delete it as well, including all testing and deployment stacks created by the pipeline. Please note that actual stack names may differ in your case, depending on the pipeline stack name you used. 

CI/CD pipeline stack deletion may fail if build artifact S3 bucket is not empty. In such case get bucket name using following command and looking for BuildArtifactsBucket resource's PhysicalResourceId:

```bash
aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline
```

Then open AWS Management Console, navigate to S3 bucket with build artifacts and empty it.

After that delete all stacks created by the CI/CD pipeline and pipeline itself:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline-Testing
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline-Cognito-Testing
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline-Deployment
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline-Cognito-Deployment
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-api-pipeline
```
